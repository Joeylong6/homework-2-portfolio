# homework-2-portfolio



This is just the beginning of my portfolio landing page and have basically tried to copy what was as opposed to wander too much into my own design as this is already hard enough  - but I have had trouble getting my nav bar to line up with the body.  I tried postioning it with an absolute wihlst making my .header positioned relative but it completely disappeared on me ! so kept my float: right - some help on that would be great. 

And I am also unclear as to what I really need to be writing in these readme.md files - 
How do i even capture my whole website page ? I tried installing screen capture by google but it is not giving me any option to capture the whole screen (as it says it should) .. only option is to capture the visible part which makes no sense to paste into my readme file.  Same if I take a screen shot .. so please, I need some more detailed information on how to make a good readme file. 

there is so much to take on-board in so little time ! 

Also what is the correct indentation of html tags - I get the gist of it but when I am getting deeper into them I am unsure as to which stay at the same level of indent so could you please give me a page to follow .. thanks.
